### Probability of buying an insurance?

* The probability of buying insurance depends on various factors including individual risk perception, financial situation, and the perceived value of the insurance coverage. It varies from person to person and is influenced by factors such as age, health, lifestyle, and the specific type of insurance being considered.

### Insurance firm can protect its customers?

* An insurance firm can protect its customers by providing various types of insurance coverage tailored to their needs, offering financial reimbursement or assistance in case of covered losses or damages.

### Importance of insurance and how it is helpful?

* Lets say about four in 10 men describe themselves as being very knowledgeable about life insurance.  As in the problem statement, about 2 or 3 get hospitalized out of 100, which means 2 to 3 percent claim the insurance. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.
